# Sync Template Improvements

Analyze a project's workflow configuration against the templates, or pull template improvements to a project.

## Usage

```
/sync-templates <project> [--reverse]
/sync-templates --reverse <project>
```

**Arguments (flexible order):**
- `<project>` - Required. Local path (`~/projects/foo`) or GitHub repo (`github.com/user/repo`)
- `--reverse` - Optional. Pull improvements FROM templates TO the project

**Examples:**
- `/sync-templates ~/side_project/household_tracker` - Analyze project for template improvements
- `/sync-templates --reverse ~/side_project/household_tracker` - Pull template improvements to project
- `/sync-templates github.com/user/repo` - Analyze a GitHub repo

## Template Locations

Auto-detected from this rule's location:
- **Cursor template**: The repository containing this rule file
- **Claude template**: Sibling directory `../claude-project-template`

## Process

### Default Mode: Project → Templates

Analyze a project to find improvements worth adding to the templates.

1. **Fetch project files**
   - Local path: Read files directly
   - GitHub repo: Use appropriate API to fetch content

2. **Compare against templates**
   - Read template files from auto-detected locations
   - Identify differences in configuration, hooks, rules, etc.

3. **Evaluate each difference**
   - Is it generalizable to most projects?
   - Did it actually improve the workflow?
   - Is it adding necessary or unnecessary complexity?

4. **Present recommendations**
   - Recommend changes worth adding to templates
   - Skip project-specific customizations
   - Ask which to apply

### Reverse Mode: Templates → Project

Pull the latest template improvements into a project.

1. **Compare templates against project**
   - Identify template features the project doesn't have
   - Check for outdated patterns in the project

2. **Evaluate relevance**
   - Which template features would benefit this project?
   - Are there project-specific reasons to skip certain features?

3. **Present recommendations**
   - Show what would be added/updated
   - Ask which to apply to the project

## What to Analyze

1. **AGENTS.md / Workflow Rules**
   - New workflow patterns that proved useful
   - Refined instructions that reduced errors
   - Better escalation/autonomous decision boundaries

2. **Settings & Permissions** (`.cursor/hooks.json`, `.cursor/mcp.json`)
   - Hook configurations worth defaulting
   - MCP server configurations that are broadly useful

3. **Hooks**
   - New hooks that enforce useful behaviors
   - Improved hook logic (better detection, clearer messages)
   - Hooks that should be removed or simplified

4. **Rules**
   - New rules that are broadly applicable
   - Rule improvements that generalize

5. **Process Documentation**
   - Ideation workflow refinements
   - Testing/verification patterns

## Evaluation Criteria

For each difference found, assess:
- **Generalizability**: Does this apply to most projects, or just this one?
- **Value**: Did this actually improve the workflow?
- **Simplicity**: Is this adding necessary complexity or unnecessary overhead?

## Output

### Default Mode (Project → Templates)
1. **Recommended improvements** - Changes worth adding to templates, with rationale
2. **Project-specific** - Things that work here but shouldn't be in templates
3. **Template issues** - Things in templates that should be removed/changed

### Reverse Mode (Templates → Project)
1. **Recommended additions** - Template features to add to the project
2. **Already present** - Template features the project has (possibly customized)
3. **Skip** - Template features not relevant to this project

Then ask which changes to apply.
