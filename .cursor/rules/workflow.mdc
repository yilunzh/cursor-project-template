# Development Workflow

## Project Overview

See `BRIEF.md` for the project description and `docs/SPEC.md` for the technical specification.

## Phase 0: BRANCH FIRST (Feature Branches Required)

Before making ANY changes:

1. **Check current branch**: `git branch --show-current`
2. **For new features**: Create feature branch
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/<feature-name>
   ```
3. **For bug fixes**: Create fix branch
   ```bash
   git checkout -b fix/<bug-description>
   ```
4. **NEVER commit directly to main** - All changes go through branches → PR

Only small, trivial changes (typo fixes, config tweaks) can go directly to main.

## Phase 1: CLARIFY FIRST (Ask Questions Before Coding)

Before writing ANY implementation code, you MUST:

1. **Read related code** - Understand existing patterns
2. **Ask clarifying questions** about:
   - Ambiguous requirements ("Should X also handle Y?")
   - User-facing text (error messages, labels)
   - Edge cases ("What happens if Z?")
   - Scope boundaries ("Does this include W?")
3. **Wait for answers** - Do NOT assume. Wrong assumptions = rework.

**For features with UI**, also clarify:
- Design inspiration (sites/apps to emulate)
- Visual style (modern, minimal, playful, etc.)
- Component library preference (if any)
- Key screens/interactions to get right

## Phase 2: PLAN (Create Implementation Plan)

After clarification, outline:
- Implementation steps
- Test steps (which tests to update/add)
- Verification step ("Run tests, confirm passing")

## Phase 3: IMPLEMENT (Autonomous Execution)

Now proceed WITHOUT asking for confirmation:
1. Make incremental changes
2. Run related tests after each change
3. Fix failures immediately
4. Continue to next step

## Phase 4: VERIFY (Before Claiming Done)

Before saying "done":
1. Run tests - all must pass
2. If user-facing changes: present options for review
3. For UI changes: verify pages load correctly

## Decision Guidelines

### ESCALATE (Ask User)
- User-facing changes (UI, messages, outputs)
- API contracts and data formats
- Error messages and notifications
- Visual design decisions
- Security-sensitive changes
- Breaking changes

### AUTONOMOUS (Just Do It)
- Internal refactoring
- Bug fixes with clear solutions
- Test improvements
- Performance optimizations
- Code organization

## Quality Guidelines

1. **Don't add CI checks the codebase doesn't pass** - Verify existing code passes before adding new checks
2. **Test locally before committing** - Run tests and lint
3. **Keep PRs small and focused** - One logical change per PR when possible

## Reference Documentation

- `BRIEF.md` - Initial project description (non-technical)
- `docs/SPEC.md` - Technical specification (grows with project)
- `docs/PATTERNS.md` - Architectural patterns reference

## SPEC.md Updates

After completing a feature, update `docs/SPEC.md`:
- Add feature to "Implemented" section
- Document key architectural decisions
- Update "Current State" as needed
