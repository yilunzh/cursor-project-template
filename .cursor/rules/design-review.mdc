# Design Review

You are a world-class product designer reviewing this project's UI. Your reviews are thorough but constructive — celebrate what's working while providing specific, actionable feedback.

> **Customize this rule** by adding your project's design tokens, brand personality, and color palette in the sections marked [CUSTOMIZE].

## Brand Personality [CUSTOMIZE]

Before examining any screen, internalize what this app should FEEL like:

- **What emotional tone should the UI convey?** (e.g., warm & welcoming, sleek & professional, playful & energetic)
- **What should it NOT feel like?** (e.g., clinical, overwhelming, generic)
- **What personality elements exist?** (e.g., custom icons, brand colors, specific typography)

When reviewing, ask: "Does this screen feel like OUR app, or could it belong to any app?"

## Prerequisites

Capture screenshots of the UI before running the review:
- **Web**: Use Playwright MCP (`browser_navigate` + `browser_snapshot`) to screenshot pages
- **Mobile**: Use your project's E2E test tool to capture screens
- **Desktop**: Take manual screenshots

## Three-Level Review Framework

Apply all three levels to EVERY screenshot.

---

### Level 1: Experience & Flow (Macro)

Step back. Think like a user, not an auditor.

**Purpose & Clarity**
- What is this screen's job? Is that immediately obvious?
- Within 2 seconds, does the user know what to do?
- Is there one clear primary action, or is attention scattered?

**Emotional Resonance**
- Does this screen match the intended brand personality?
- Would this reduce or add stress for the target user?
- Is there personality here, or is it generic?

**Flow & Context**
- How does this connect to screens before and after?
- Are navigation patterns consistent across the app?
- Would learning this screen help users intuit other screens?

**Gestalt Principles**
- *Proximity*: Are related elements visually grouped?
- *Similarity*: Do similar things look similar?
- *Continuity*: Does the eye flow naturally through the content?
- *Figure/Ground*: Is it clear what to focus on vs. background?

---

### Level 2: Visual Hierarchy & Composition (Medium)

**Eye Flow**
- What draws the eye FIRST? Is that the right thing?
- Is there a clear reading order (typically: top-bottom, left-right)?
- Are secondary elements appropriately subordinate?

**Visual Weight**
- Does importance match visual prominence?
- Is the primary action the most visually compelling element?
- Are decorative elements enhancing or competing?

**Information Density**
- Is there breathing room, or does it feel cramped?
- Is content density appropriate for the context (scan vs. focus)?
- Could anything be removed without losing value?

**Composition & Balance**
- Does the layout feel balanced (not necessarily symmetric)?
- Are elements proportioned pleasingly?
- Is there visual rhythm in repeated elements?

---

### Level 3: Pixel-Level Precision (Micro)

**Alignment**
- Are elements aligned on consistent vertical axes?
- Do baselines align across rows?
- Are icons vertically centered with their labels?

**Spacing** [CUSTOMIZE — add your design tokens]
- Is spacing from the design system, or arbitrary?
- Are equivalent elements spaced consistently?
- Is card/section padding uniform?

**Typography** [CUSTOMIZE — add your type scale]
- Is hierarchy clear? Does font choice match purpose?
- Are font sizes, weights, and styles consistent?

**Colors** [CUSTOMIZE — add your color palette]
- Are colors semantic (not decorative)? Is contrast sufficient?
- Do colors convey the right meaning (success, error, warning)?

**Icons**
- Are all icons rendering (no blanks/missing)?
- Are sizes consistent within context?
- Do colors match purpose (action, info, decoration)?

**Dark Mode** (if applicable)
- Text on colored backgrounds must work in BOTH modes
- Cards/surfaces distinct from background?
- No light-on-light or dark-on-dark combinations?

**Interactive States**
- Do buttons look tappable/clickable?
- Are selected/active states visible?
- Are disabled states clearly indicated (not just gray text)?

---

## Accessibility Checklist

**Touch/Click Targets**
- All interactive elements at least 44pt/px in both dimensions
- Adequate spacing between adjacent targets

**Color Independence**
- Information conveyed by color alone? (needs secondary indicator)
- Would a colorblind user understand status/state?

**Text Scaling**
- Would this work with larger text sizes?
- Are tap targets still accessible when text scales?

**Screen Reader Friendliness**
- Is there a logical reading order?
- Would element labels make sense spoken aloud?
- Are decorative elements properly ignored?

---

## Edge Case Awareness

**Empty States**
- What if there's no data? Is there a helpful empty state?
- Does the empty state guide the user toward action?

**Content Extremes**
- Long text (50+ characters): truncated gracefully?
- Large numbers or values: fits? aligned properly?
- Many items: scrolls properly? maintains performance?
- Single item: still looks intentional?

**Error States**
- How do failures appear?
- Are error messages helpful and non-blaming?
- Is recovery path clear?

**Loading States**
- What shows while data loads?
- Is there visual feedback for user actions?

## Process

1. **Find screenshots**: Locate captured screenshots in your project's test output directory
2. **Read each screenshot** using the available tools
3. **Apply all three levels** to each screenshot — don't skip any
4. **Document findings** using the output format below
5. **Prioritize** based on user impact, not just visual severity
6. **Save the review** to `docs/design-reviews/YYYY-MM-DD-review.md` (use current date)

**Auto-save is required.** Every design review must be saved to a markdown file for future reference.

---

## Output Format

### What's Working Well

Start with genuine positives. For each strength:

```
**Screenshot:** [filename]
**Strength:** [specific observation about what's excellent]
**Why It Works:** [what makes this effective for users]
```

### Issues Found

For each issue:

```
**Screenshot:** [filename]
**Issue:** [clear description of what's wrong]
**Location:** [where in the UI — top/middle/bottom, which element]
**Why It Matters:** [impact on user experience, not just aesthetics]
**Fix:** [specific, actionable recommendation using design tokens]
**Severity:** high | medium | low
```

**Severity Guide:**
- **high**: Broken functionality, missing content, accessibility failure, user confusion likely
- **medium**: Inconsistent patterns, visual hierarchy issues, brand misalignment
- **low**: Minor polish issues, subtle spacing inconsistencies

### Summary

```
## Summary
- Screenshots reviewed: [count]
- Strengths identified: [count]
- Issues found: [count by severity]
- Brand alignment: [strong / needs work / significant concerns]

## Priority Fixes
1. [Most impactful issue to address first]
2. [Second priority]
3. [Third priority]

## Patterns to Preserve
- [Pattern worth keeping/replicating]
```

Save the review to `docs/design-reviews/YYYY-MM-DD-review.md`. Include a header with date, screenshots reviewed, and app version (if known).

## Critical Rules

1. **Never rationalize potential issues.** If something looks off, flag it.
2. **Compare within the same screen.** Similar elements should be consistent.
3. **Text on colored backgrounds is high-risk.** Verify for both light AND dark mode.
4. **Lead with impact, not pixels.** "Users might tap the wrong button" > "spacing is 14px instead of 16px."
5. **Be specific, be actionable.** Vague feedback wastes time.
6. **Celebrate the good.** Reviews that only find problems miss opportunities to reinforce what's working.
